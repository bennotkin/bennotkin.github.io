[^†]: Did you, too, first learn the word *cordial*, as a beverage, from *Redwall*? If so, I'm sad to report it appears the script was [scrapped](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/netflix-redwall-patrick-mchale-update). For an onion cordial, which we most likely will not be imbibing, see this lesser-Saskatchewanly named [liqueur](https://www.italianfoodexcellence.com/regina-the-first-italian-onion-liqueur/).
