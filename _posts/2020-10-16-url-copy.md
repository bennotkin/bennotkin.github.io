Being awful at obeying xkcd's "Is It Worth the Time?"[°](https://xkcd.com/1205/) I stitched together a wee little Automator script that, in Safari for now, copies highlighted text and appends the URL as a link. (Following Butterick's Practical Typography's[°](https://practicaltypography.com/) usage, I've set it up so the link appears as °, like a indexless footnote.)
