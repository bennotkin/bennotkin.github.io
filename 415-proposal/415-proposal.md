## Vision

### Union gets to be a foothold into South Lake Union.

For the past decade Union has beautifully challenged who belongs in Seattle's fancy tech district.

::: hide ::::::
~~~One of the most beautiful aspects of Union's abundant and diverse<!-- dappled --> operation<!-- over the past decade--> is how it has challenged who belongs in Seattle's fancy tech district.
::::::

This development project is an opportunity to continue this subversion at an even greater scale. <!--This proposal document -->Through housing, offices, retail and other social infrastructure, Union gets to extend access to people and organizations who are otherwise excluded from life in South Lake Union.

~~~Union uses its land to give otherwise excluded people and organizations access to Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood, through a multi-owner and democratically controlled development project. Housing includes rent-restricted units, a limited equity cooperative and market rate units. The development also features a non-profit hub and resident-defined retail space. [Something about participation and other values and procedural elements.] -->

### So how can Union be that foothold? How can Union steward God's land to best serve people?
::::::

Union has already committed to the important work of providing affordable housing. Seattle, and the country, has a housing crisis, and it's only getting worse with the pandemic. Anything Union can do to support housing is worthy work. Even with this commitment, though lots of questions remain. What kind of affordable housing, and for whom? What happens in the non-residential parts of the building?

<!-- return to this whole intro -->This proposal exists to consider these questions. Beneath these questions lie many more, and in this document I ask you a few of them. [Here](#questions) is a fuller set. These are questions to ask ourselves throughout the development process, in every phase. By asking and answering these questions we can start to imagine what 415 Westlake can become. In this document I propose some possibilities and also provide some broader takeaways.<!-- should these be links -->

- Questions to consider
- Precedents
- Insights from other churches

<!-- I also include some of my own answers. This document presents a few ideas of what the project could be, as well as some more abstract takeaways. -->

## Core Elements

### Non-profit hub <!-- if i do use a section, these captions could still be included, perhaps with hover -->
Multiple non-profits have space together and benefit by being near each other and other SLU players.

### Distributed ownership
Multiple missional partners own equity shares, reducing the need for external investment.

### Limited Equity Cooperative
Residents own affordable shares of the building and share decision-making power.

### Co-housing (encourage roommates)
More of residential life is moved into common spaces, increasing interactions and keeping construction and rent costs down.

### Need-meeting Social Infrastructure 
Retail space is cooperatively owned and units have smaller footprints, allowing retail to meet the needs of the building's and neighborhood's residents.
<!-- Resident Retail Cooperative; extend beyond the walls of -->

### Permanently affordable
The housing will continue to be affordable for decades.

### What are the benefits of being in South Lake Union?

This project exists in a particular place with particular characteristics – a place that<!--, because of and causing those characteristics,--> is one of the nation's most invested-in neighborhoods.<!--As we design this project we need to take into account these local conditions, while not ignoring broader regional, national and even global phenomenon.--><!--These characteristics should guide our development process.--> With this project Union has the opportunity to expand who gets to take advantage of these sought after traits.

What, then, are these characteristics? What are the benefits of SLU that Union can share?

<textarea name="benefits-input" placeholder="List some benefits of being in SLU, not only for Union, but for anyone or any group." rows=4></textarea>

Your anonymous response will be sent to the project's vision team.

::: {.benefits-list .swot-list} :::
#### Here are some previous answers
<!-- at some point make it *dynamic* and add in their interactive answers -->

- __Centrality__ Close to downtown and Capitol Hill and centrally located among residential neighborhoods
- __Co-location__ Lots of power and socially-recognized skill, especially in tech and medicine.
- __Active__ Busy streets with lots of (daytime) foot traffic
- __Social services__ [Is this very true?]
- __Walkable__ ...
- __Transit__ ... [true?]
- __Rising Land Value__ For people and groups that already own land, speculation provides economic return
- __Nearby Jobs__ Many jobs of many varieties within walking distance
- __Invested In__

#### There are challenges as well

- __Presumption of Wealth__ E.g. the main grocery store is a Whole Foods
- __Congestion__
- __High Cost of Land__
- __Daytime Only__ Though its changing, SLU is primarily a workday neighborhood and clears out at night

### How can these benefits shape how Union uses its land?

The project should 

Many of these strengths are work-related
