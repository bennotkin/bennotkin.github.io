## Vision

### Union gets to be a foothold into South Lake Union

For the past decade Union has beautifully challenged who belongs in Seattle's fancy tech district.

This development project is an opportunity to continue this subversion at an even greater scale. Through housing, offices, retail and other social infrastructure, Union gets to extend access to people and organizations who are otherwise excluded from life in South Lake Union.

### First, what are your thoughts?
Any design should begin by asking people questions

### What are the benefits of being in South Lake Union, for the church and for anyone or any group?

### Who are the projects potential users?
A key step in design thinking is to consider the design from the perspective of its users. Who do you consider to be the "users" of the project? Who is affected by it? Some "users" might never actually visit the building and still be affected by it

::: conviction :::
## Conviction One
### Participation is important
A project performs better and is more just when people who are affected by it are involved in the design process.

Many questions, like those above, need to be asked and need to be asked of a wide audience. Engagement is important for reasons of both equity and practicality. More participation allows for broader community support. This support is important throughout the process. It also means the project will better serve the people it affects.

See <a href="TKTK">participation</a> and <a href="TKTK">questions to ask</a>.
:::


::: conviction :::
## Conviction Two
Vision development is as legitimate preparatory work as financial feasibility and massing studies.

Financial analysis is only important if a project matters. Knowing whether a project is feasible is different from knowing what is needed and what should be.

Vision development
- requires more than a space audit
- looks beyond existing programming
- engages the community and the public
- assesses needs
- finds partners
:::

::: conviction :::
## Conviction Three
### The project should respond to its context
#### The benefits and challenges of South Lake Union should inform the physical, programmatic and tenurial design and process.

#### Some of SLU's benefits
- __Centrality__ Close to downtown and Capitol Hill and centrally located among residential neighborhoods
- __Co-location__ Lots of power and socially-recognized skill, especially in tech and medicine.
- __Active__ Busy streets with lots of (daytime) foot traffic
- __Social services__ [Is this very true?]
- __Walkable__ ...
- __Transit__ ... [true?]
- __Rising Land Value__ For people and groups that already own land, speculation provides economic return
- __Nearby Jobs__ Many jobs of many varieties within walking distance
- __Invested In__

#### Some challenges
- __Presumption of Wealth__ E.g. the main grocery store is a Whole Foods
- __Congestion__
- __High Cost of Land__
- __Daytime Only__ Though its changing, SLU is primarily a workday neighborhood and clears out at night
:::

::: conviction :::
## Conviction Four
### Expand who we consider to be stakeholders
#### We need to consider the project from the perspective of its future users. To be just, we need to challenge and broaden our initial thoughts of who these users are.

Current stakeholders include Union, students being tutored during covid, women staying in the women's shelter, venue-renting groups, cafe patrons, and the organizations Union partners with. As we discuss affordable housing, the City of Seattle, the LIHTC investor and the developer become stakeholders as well.

Who else are our stakeholders?
:::

:::
## Conviction Five

### Distribute ownership and control

For a project this size, Union will have to give up control and ownership. Union can choose who it shares this control and ownership with. Union should distribute ownership among a coalition of missional partners so that less equity is required from investment-oriented partners.
:::

::: lo-image-right :::
## Conviction Six
### The project pursues equity and justice, throughout design, development and operation

### Proposal
Affordable housing with institutional partnerships, a non-profit hub, and cooperatively owned ground floor retail.
:::

:::
## Proposal
### We're doing affordable housing! Now what?
Union has committed to using the land it stewards to provide affordable housing. In a city and an era with a housing crisis, this is an incredibly important project. Still, lots of questions remain.

#### What kind of housing and for whom?
<!-- maybe add in more questions here -->
#### What are the non-residential activities in the building?
<!-- – and questions about the non-residential aspects of the building – _what's on the ground floor? how does the building's construction and operation relate to climate change?_ -->
:::

:::
## Proposal
### Housing is important but insufficient
#### South Lake Union is increasingly residential, but is still primarily a working district*

The main benefits of South Lake Union are its central location in the city, the proximity to powerful players (and their workers) in tech, medicine and research, and, for landowners, the rising land value.

Union can more maximally share access to these benefits than by simply providing affordable housing. While residents can take advantage of South Lake Union's merits, non-profits and businesses are more poised to gain from the neighborhood's locational strengths.

Regarding housing, Union can share access to the rising land value by giving occupants shares of equity.


* One advantage of South Lake Union being not-quite-residential is that this project gets to help set the tone for what kind of residential neighborhood it is and for whom.
:::

:::
## Proposal
### Partnering with other organizations harnesses other sources of funding and support
By developing a coalition of non-profit and pro-public partners, Union grows the mission of the project. The partner organizations bring their talents, experience, resources and networks.
Having these groups on board in the development process expands the vision of the project as each contributes their own aspirations and understanding of what is possible. Having more partners does complicate the process by introducing new actors, but these additional actors help move the center of influence toward pro-social aspirations.

### Ground Floor

![Ground floor](images/section-line-ground.svg)
:::

:::
## Proposal: Ground Floor

### Take advantage of the long street front

The site's 120–180 feet on Westlake is an opportunity for a porous, interactive and welcoming building. Put retail and other services on the ground floor.

Most people interacting with the building won't be living in it or attending events. They'll be walking by. How can we activate the ground floor so that it invites passersby in? How can the ground floor serve people who live or work nearby?

With retail on the ground floor, Union can give otherwise excluded businesses access to SLU's dense activity, while also giving residents and workers the services they need.
:::


::: {.lo-image-right}
## Proposal: Ground Floor
### Provide missing social infrastructure to serve residents and broader community
Make SLU a neighborhood for lower income folks by providing accessible retail and services.
By putting retail and services on the ground floor, Union has the opportunity to pair affordable housing with affordable and relevant retail and services. Responsible low-income housing depends on access to accessible and pertinent social infrastructure.

This retail will serve not only the building's residents, but also other residents and workers in the neighborhood, and broader city.

::: {.lo-image-right}
## Proposal: Ground Floor
### Make retail affordable by making it small
120 feet of street frontage could fit six 20' storefronts – plus more in the alley!

Retail space is often unaffordable not only because of high rents per square foot, but also because of large areas. New developments often build very large retail stalls to attract more stable national chains, and reduce the number of tenants they need to manage.

![Bow Market](images/temp2.png)
:::

:::
## Proposal: Ground Floor
### Cooperative retail space lets residents decide what's needed
Residents know best what kind of retail and services they need. Let residents own shares of the retail space.

- Includes residents of building and broader neighborhood or community (see CLT governance model)
- Includes other in-building organizations
- Gives residents a say in how the space is used, so that it meets real needs
- Lets residents financially (and programmatically) benefit from retail space
- Ensures a loyal audience for retail tenants
- Distributes equity ownership
- Uses security deposits and last months rent as share payments, keeping shares affordable for building occupants

## Proposal

### Venue Floor

![Ground floor](images/section-line-venue.svg)
:::

::: .lo-image-right
## Proposal: Venue Floor
### Venue space can focus on public events.
In the past, Union has relied on renting out the venue to make rent and mortgage payments. If Union is debt-free after development, the venue can focus on more non-profit and pro-public events.
For ten years, 415 Westlake has facilitated important events that would be impossible without affordable event space. These events can now become the priority. 415 can focus on its mission to give non-profits access to assembly space in a central, active neighborhood.

### Co-programmed with building occupants
Like in 415's history, many of these events will be put on by other organizations that lease the space, but now the venue can dedicate more energy to hosting more of its own events. 415 Westlake can become a public cultural and social event space, with film screenings, meals, poetry slams, new-to-Seattle events, trainings, forums, etc. Union, as Union, as 415 Westlake, and as Kakao, has already hosted these events, but can now commit more of the calendar to them.
Programming these events takes serious effort and creativity. Union could plan them entirely internally, but this is also an opportunity to partner with other organizations. The other non-profits in the non-profit hub, with their own focuses, audiences and connections, could co-program the space with Union. The venue space is a space to be shared with these partner organizations and with the public.

:::

:::
## Proposal: Venue Floor
### A second floor venue also means deck space for the venue.
Instead of a through-block connection, or a street-facing patio, the venue can have its own outdoor space with sky above.
As designed in Weber Thompson's massing study, this deck space is already required by zoning. Unlike a through-block connection or a patio, this space can be totally private – though Union could let the public use it when no events are taking place. The deck could also be used by the cafe or other retail. 
:::

::: floors :::
## Proposal

### Offices

![Ground floor](images/section-line-office.svg)
:::

:::
## Proposal: Offices
### A non-profit hub brings otherwise excluded organizations together and into SLU
South Lake Union is a commercial district and its assets are most attractive to businesses and organizations. Medical and tech non-profits, especially, could hugely benefit from being near SLU's power players and their employees. Other non-profits focus on SLU's more forgotten communities – like people experiencing homelessness, lower income residents, or wage workers.
The third and fourth floors are office space for Union and for organizations that could take advantage of SLU's location, as well as benefit from being near each other and Union. These organizations have their own offices, while also sharing space and resources to keep operation more affordable. They may also co-program the venue space.
Each of these organizations has its own donor networks and access to funding. By partnering with these organizations early on and including them in the development process, the project could benefit from a much broader capital campaign. Per organization, the capital costs of development will be much lower because of sharing space and construction, and because they don't need to purchase land.
:::

:::
## Proposal: Offices
### Non-profit co-working
Other organizations are too small to join the development process but would still benefit from being in South Lake Union. Some of the offices could be co-working space exclusively for non-profits.
:::

::: floors :::
## Proposal

### Housing

![Ground floor](images/section-line-housing.svg)
:::

:::
## Proposal: Housing
### Partner with other institutions
Union dedicates some of the units to specific populations that are tied to specific institutions. These institutions could own a set of units, providing equity to the project upfront, or could ensure that units are always filled.
For example, Seattle Presbytery and other denominations own some units as clergy housing, or the teachers union owns units for teachers.

::: hide ::::::
  		- E.g. teachers, SLU wage labor, university-affiliated, indigenous people, people who were formerly homeless, clergy (beyond Union), seniors
		- Focusing on some populations could allow for institutional relationships that ensure units are filled and could even provide financial equity: if Seattle Public Schools or UW partnered could we have an arrangement where they purchase a number of units and manager
::::::


:::

::: lo-image-right
## Proposal: Housing
### Give residents ownership through a limited equity cooperative
Residents own shares in the building, allowing them to build wealth and have a say in decision-making.
Affordable rental housing is accessible, but doesn't change who financially benefits from housing. In a limited equity cooperative (LEC), like in a traditional homeownership, people can build wealth with their housing payments. Depending on the equity restrictions, this could also let residents benefit partially from SLU's rising land values. Unlike traditional homeownership, however, the resale values are capped and limited to people with a certain income level or less, so the shares stay affordable for future users.
With ownership comes not only the possibility to build equity, but also a say in decisions about the property. Somewhat like a condo, an LEC is a cooperative where members collectively decide on maintenance, resale, income levels, utilities, etc. The LEC could also be the mechanism for making decisions about ground floor retail. 
Union would benefit with more cash up front if another organization intermediately bought the units to then distribute to residents. The model would distribute equity ownership among low income residents, instead of tax credit investors. This co-ownership is also an missional opportunity to _enter into partnership_ with low-income residents.

## Proposal: Housing
### Make housing cheaper and more relational with co-housing
More of residential life is moved into common spaces, increasing interactions between residents and keeping construction and rent costs down.
Co-housing is an increasingly popular model for commercial developments, because it reduces construction costs and enables developers to build more units in less space. In these models, the premise of _community_ is largely a conceit to increase profits, and isn't supported with meaningful programming.

When co-housing is supported, however, it is a way of reducing costs for renters while also providing social connections that can be difficult to achieve, especially when living alone in a new city. In the corporate model, the programming that does exist is often exclusively for residents. More successful models, though, connect residents with life beyond the building, by inviting non-residents in. Union, with its programming as a church, as a cafe, and as a venue, already provides some of this.
:::

:::
## Proposal: Participation
### Bringing in other voices expands the vision.
Community engagement is important for making the project relevant to real needs, for creating a stronger vision, for developing support, and for realizing people's right to develop their city.
Access to a city means not only the ability to visit, use or live in the city, but the ability to shape and influence it – to co-design what it _should be_. This is a rare opportunity anywhere in any city, but especially in South Lake Union, which is owned and designed by some of the world's wealthiest companies and individuals. This project is a rare chance for individuals – within and beyond Union – to say what they want South Lake Union to be, and work towards making it real.

As a congregation of people, Union has tremendous opportunity for widespread participation. Union is a diverse body of people from across the city with many different perspectives and assessments of need. This wisdom is invaluable for understanding what this project could or should be. The congregation also connects Union to the broader community, whose input is also generative and important.

Community engagement also builds community support. A project of this scale often receives public opposition. When the broader community identifies with the project and sees it as in their interest, they are more likely to support the project in the face of opposition. (See <a href="...">Other Churches' Insights</a> below.

Below are a handful of ideas about what participation could look like.
:::

:::
## Proposal: Participation
### Distributed ownership
The development process is this new project's first phase of life, and lots of decisions will be made in this period. Many decisions about the building and how it should be used – how the building serves people's interest – will be made after development. By distributing ownership to residents, neighbors and other organizations, such as through an LEC or retail cooperatives, Union provides a democratic means by which people continue to have a say in the project.
:::

:::
## Proposal: Participation
### Collaboratively draw a "map from below"
South Lake Union carries easy associations with tech, medicine and business, but this is an incomplete portrayal of the neighborhood. As a congregation and beyond, draw a people's map of South Lake Union, highlighting social services, relationships, resources, hostilities, art, transit, etc.
I'll try to set up an interactive map that lets people add markers for different spots, but people could also draw on an image of SLU, or could verbally describe locations.

![Interactive leaflet](images/temp1.png)
:::

::: lo-image-right
## Proposal: Participation
### Start a virtual conversation with weekly questions
Have people to dream and analyze together by providing questions each week via email, text, and Instagram, and encouraging people to share their answers.
These questions help people feel they have ownership of the project, and can generate important ideas. Thinking about these prompts can also be a helpful reflective tool for individuals or families, as they consider their values, their city, and their relationship to it. When engaging people, it's important to ask both wide-open and more specific questions. Give people the freedom to dream out of nothing, but also let them respond to firmer prompts. 

This virtual outreach could happen on many platforms. On Instagram, Union (and Kakao and 415 Westlake) could post a question, and encourage followers to respond via an Instagram story – further spreading the engagement. Via email and text message, Union could also send out questions, and then the next week send people each other's anonymous (or not) answers for them to respond to. (I'm excited about this one. It's also less complicated than it sounds. Let's talk more about it.)

::: hide ::::::
Unlike most projects, Union has/_is_ a built-in audience it can immediately engage. While we're all staying home, start a virtual conversation by sending out weekly questions that people can publicly or privately respond to.
::::::

![Instagram story screenshot](images/temp3.png)

:::

::: lo-image-right
## Proposal: Participation
### Host a teach-in to broaden the conversation
Leaning in to being a public and cultural venue, Union hosts speakers and educators on topics related to affordable housing, public space, urban democracy, co-housing, cooperative retail, etc.

These events introduce new concepts and language for Union's project, broadening the conversation about what could be, while also being relevant beyond the specific project.

:::

:::
## Proposal: Participation
### Have a Bible study on land
Whether a weekly event or a one-weekend (virtual) retreat, a Bible study on themes of stewardship and mission with an explicit tie to the new development could generate new scripture-based thoughts on what the building could.
:::

:::
## Proposal: Participation
### Reach out to Union's network's networks
Union is a broad network, and each of its members is part of their own network. Have the people of Union reach out to their external communities to ask how they could benefit from a project in South Lake Union.
By continuing to expand who is included in the design process, Union can better understand how the project should be used, and also learn what resources and possibilities exist.
:::

::: church-insights :::
## Other Churches' Insights
### Union has a unique project, and can also learn from previous church land development projects

- _Set your sights high._ The final build never looks like the render drawings. The project will inevitably fall short of your aspirations. When materials and loans get expensive, you'll concede your dreams. This doesn't mean to shrink your expectations. It means to grow them. By starting with a loftier vision the final result, after all the concessions, will retain more imagination.<!-- fix please oh please --><!--Set your sights high. Your impossible castle in the sky will inevitably fade to something much more boring but feasible. But by starting with a bigger vision, the eroded shrunk result will be grander than what you'd get by starting small. -->

- _Congregation needs to own the vision._<!-- yikes ownership language--> The development process is arduous and often lasts much longer than expected. The project needs widespread support.

- _Involve people beyond the congregation._ The project will likely run into opposition of some kind. The best way to ensure a smooth development process is to have thorough support from the broader public. The more people beyond the congregation that want to see the project happen, the more easily it'll happen. Get community support by involving people in the development process.

- _Partner with existing institutions._ The new build often means entering into new kinds of work that the congregation doesn't have experience or expertise in. This is an opportunity to enter into missional partnership with groups that already do this kind of work.

## Questions
### Let's keep asking questions
These are a few questions for leadership to ask of itself, of the Union congregation, and the broader community. This list is, of course, incomplete. They are reflection questions to ask now, and throughout the design and development process. The questions range in complexity: some are quick to answer and could be sent out in an email; others may require discussion and other underlying questions.
<!-- reorganize into same or diff categories -->

#### Context
