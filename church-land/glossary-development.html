<div class="defintions">
    <div> <h3 id="affordable-housing">Affordable Housing</h3>
<p><strong>Affordable housing</strong> is a vague term that can imprecisely describe housing’s rent price or how it is funded. Housing is considered affordable when its monthly rent (or mortgage loan payment) is less than 30% of its household’s monthly income. Whether housing is affordable, therefore, depends on the incomes of the people expected to live in it. Often, affordable housing refers to any housing which is affordable to households earning less than the <a href="#ami">area median income</a>. This threshold varies: affordable could mean affordable to 80% AMI or to 120% AMI.</p>
<p>Note that affordable housing is different than low-income housing. Low-income is typically defined as 30% AMI.</p>
<p>While some market-rate housing is affordable, known as naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH), the term affordable housing is often used to describe only housing that is government supported (such as through <a href="#lihtc">low-income housing tax credits</a>) and rent-regulated.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="ami">AMI, or Area Median Income</h3>
<p>Also known as family median income (FMI), <strong>area median income</strong> is the middle annual income for all households of a given size in a given metropolitan area or non-metropolitan area. This means that half the households of that size earn more than the AMI each year and half earn less. Affordability is often defined in terms of the AMI level for whom the housing is affordable. For example, Seattle’s low-income public housing prioritizes households earning 30% or less of area median income, or 30% AMI.</p>
<p>In the Seattle-area, which includes King, Pierce and Snohomish counties, 100% AMI in 2019 was</p>
<ul>
<li>$76,000 for a 1-person household;</li>
<li>$86,900 for a 2-person household;</li>
<li>$97,750 for a 3-person household;</li>
<li>$108,600 for a 4-person household; and</li>
<li>$117,300 for a 5-person household.</li>
</ul>
<p>AMI is calculated each year by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="capitalized-value">Capitalized value</h3>
<p>The <strong>capitalized value</strong> is the value of a property based on the income it brings in each year. It is the sum of a building’s anticipated income, with future income discounted by how far into the future it is.</p>
<p>The capitalized value can also be considered the amount of money you would need to invest in other assets to achieve similar returns. At time of development, then, capitalized value is typically calculated based on the expected value of similar income streams in the local market.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="condo">Condominium ownership or “Condominimize”</h3>
<p>The <strong>condominium</strong> is a legal arrangement which enables a single property to be divided into individually owned portions collectively owned portions.</p>
<p>In a condominium, each owner owns one or multiple units and co-owns the building or complex’s common area (area not within individual owners’ units) with all the other owners. The term condominium can refer to the overall property, a unit within the whole, or the arrangement.</p>
<p>Most often we encounter the term in reference to residential condos, in which individuals own a unit in an apartment building or housing complex. However, condominium refers to any property that has been divided into separately owned units and jointly owned common area. These units do not need to be residential, and could themselves contain multiple units that are rented to tenants.</p>
<p>A condo is distinct from a cooperative in that in a condo entities own specific units, whereas in a cooperative entities own a share of the whole property, which in turn entitles them to use units.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="cooperative">Cooperative</h3>
<p>A <strong>cooperative</strong> is a co-ownership arrangement in which entities own unit- and space-inspecific shares of a property, which in turn entitles them to a lease or contract for a unit or units in the property.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="developer">Developer</h3>
<p>In a real estate project, the <strong>developer</strong> coordinates the transformation of piece of land from one condition into another. This includes acquiring funding, filing permits and hiring firms that perform the analysis, engagement, design, engineering, and construction work. Some developers will perform some of these activities in-house. Developers will at times continue managing a property after construction, but typically developers will sell the project once it is completed, or even mid-process. Typically the developer owns the property, fully or partially, and carries the mortgage loan, but not always (see, for example, for <a href="#fee-based-developer">fee-based developers</a>).</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="debt-service">Debt Service</h3>
<p><strong>Debt service</strong> is the sum of money that each year repays a loan. It includes both interest payments and principal payments. The <strong>debt service coverage ratio</strong> is the ratio of net operating income to annual debt service. In an affordable housing project, the project’s net income should be at least 1.15 times greater than the debt service.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="equity">Equity</h3>
<p>In development projects, <strong>equity</strong> typically refers to the value of the land and capital invested in a project which is not a loan. When expressed as a percentage It is the share a party owns in a project.</p>
<p>This definition, however, sidelines the more important sense of the term <strong>equity</strong>, which describes the justice of a project, and the fairness of who it benefits. Because of the inaccessibility of financial equity, development projects primarily benefit those who already had access to financial equity, whether through wealth or social capital. Not only do entities providing financial equity have more influence in the development project, thereby designing the building and its programs according to their interests, they also earn the financial returns. Who has access to this financial equity, however, is deeply <em>inequitable</em> and the result of historical and contemporary policies of racism and exclusion. For a project to be equitable it needs to address the unequal access to financial equity through the distribution of both material and immaterial benefits.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="far-or-floor-area-ratio">FAR, or Floor Area Ratio</h3>
<p><strong>Floor area ratio</strong> is a building’s total area (summing the area on each floor) divided by the area of the lot it is on. For example, a building with four 1,000 square feet floors on a 2,000 square foot lot would have an FAR of 2: 4 ✕ 1,000 / 2000 = 2.</p>
<p>FAR is used in form-based code to set the minimum and maximum amount of buildable area on a lot.</p>
<p>Also known as Floor Space Ratio (FSR) or Floor Space Index (FSI).</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="fee-based-developer">Fee-based Developer</h3>
<p>Typically a developer’s profits come from a projects returns, whether through the yearly operating income or through the sale of the project after (or even during) construction. A <strong>fee-based developer</strong>, on the other hand, has no equity in the project. Their fee is typically a percentage of total development costs.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="fmi">FMI</h3>
<p>See <a href="#ami">AMI</a>.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="form-based-code-or-form-based-zoning">Form-based Code, or Form-based Zoning</h3>
<p>Zoning which stipulates the design characteristics rather than use for buildings in a specified area. These characteristics can include maximum FAR, building materials, setbacks, etc.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="funding">Funding</h3>
<p>Development projects typically cost much more than the initial owner can afford. The developer must, then, look to other sources of funding. Typically, this funding is in the form of a loan. However, because the income of an affordable housing project is usually insufficient to afford the yearly payments on the necessary loan, affordable housing projects often seek grants, subsidies and other interest-free sources of financing.</p>
<p>See <a href="#equity">equity</a> and <a href="lihtc">low-income housing tax credits</a>.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="ground-lease-or-land-lease">Ground Lease, or Land Lease</h3>
<p>A ground lease is a long-term lease, typically 50–100 years, that enables the lessee to use, and often develop, land, which continues to belong to the lessor. A ground lease is similar to other leases but with greater duration and permissions. Often the lessee will in turn lease units on the property to other lessees.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="lihtc">LIHTC, or Low-income Housing Tax Credits</h3>
<p>For the last three decades, the primary way the US government has supported affordable housing is through <strong>low income housing tax credits</strong> (LIHTC, pronounced `<em>ly-tech</em>). The federal government allots these tax credits to each state; states, in turn, distribute the tax credits to qualifying affordable housing projects. Affordable housing projects then (typically) sell these tax credits and 99.99% of equity to investors through a syndicator. Currently, $1 of tax benefit sells for about 94¢. Receiving this lump sum allows an affordable housing project to take out a smaller loan.</p>
<p>Each state has a limited quantity of credits they can distribute and so qualifying is competitive. Federal legislation requires that, for at least 15 years, 20% of units are affordable at 50% AMI or 40% are affordable at 60% AMI. States, however, often have stricter requirements. The program is discretionary, so there is no set formula for achieving eligibility.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="low-income-housing">Low-income Housing</h3>
<p><strong>Low-income housing</strong> can describe housing for households earning less than 30% AMI (or $22,800 for 1 person in the Settle area). It can also refer to housing using the low-income housing tax credit, which is often targeted at 60% AMI households.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="ltv-or-loan-to-value">LTV, or Loan-to-Value</h3>
<p><strong>Loan-to-value</strong> is the ratio of the loan taken out for a project to the value of the project, expressed as a ratio: a $65,000 loan to build a project valued at $100,000 would have an LTV of 65%. The value of the project is the estimated <a href="#capitalized-value">capitalized value</a>, but sometimes total development cost is used instead.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="market-rate">Market Rate</h3>
<p><strong>Market rate</strong> housing is housing whose rent (or sale price) is not regulated by policy or program. Market rate rent prices are set to maximize income, given the unit’s location and condition, rather than to ensure people have access to housing they can afford. Market rate housing can still be affordable, if the demand for the housing’s condition or location caps its rent below 100% AMI.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="massing-and-feasibility-studies">Massing and Feasibility Studies</h3>
<p>In the early phases of development, a project goes through massing and feasibility studies to identify what is possible on the site. In <strong>massing studies</strong> architects consider zoning restrictions, environmental factors, and client requests to make initial drawings for a building. These initial drawings are not the designs for the project, but are used to identify the maximum area and number of units that could be built.</p>
<p>A <strong>feasibility study</strong> is the analysis of whether a project, given its potential area and number of units, as well as other internal and external factors, is financially viable.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="mixed-income-housing">Mixed-income Housing</h3>
<p><strong>Mixed income housing</strong> houses people of various income levels. Generally this means some of the units are market rate and some are regulated to be affordable.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="permiting-phase">Permiting Phase</h3>
<p>Before a project begins construction, it must be reviewed by the local government to ensure the plans do not threaten the laborers constructing it, the occupants, surrounding neighbors, the environment or the public well-being. If the review commission approves the project, it gives the developer permission to build. This process may take many months, depending on the number of projects in the city waiting for the commission’s review. This waiting period increases the cost of a project because it delays when a project can begin operation and start bringing in revenue. The commission may fast-track projects that the City wants built.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="podium">Podium</h3>
<p>The tower and podium form is a common high rise design, in which the first few floors, the <strong>podium</strong>, have a much larger footprint than the rest of the floors, the <strong>tower</strong>, which provide most of the height. This design is often in response to form-based code that limits lot coverage above a specified base height. Generally this code exists to ensure more natural light reaches the street level and to avoid an urban canyon phenomenon.</p>
<p>The code for 415 Westlake allows an 85’ base height, above which the building can cover no more than 50% of the lot.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="public-housing">Public Housing</h3>
<p><strong>Public housing</strong> is housing owned and managed by public housing authorities. In the first half of the twentieth century, public housing was the primary way government provided affordable housing until it switched to strategies of supporting private properties, first through Section 8 of the 1937 Housing Act and then through LIHTC. Public housing still exists, but is rarely constructed.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="section-8-housing">Section 8 Housing</h3>
<p>Section 8 of the 1937 Housing Act established two programs to subsidize housing for very low-income households in privately owned buildings. The <strong>project-based Section 8</strong> program subsidizes housing units that are dedicated to households earning less than 30% AMI, with the subsidy covering the difference between an affordable rent (30% * 30% * AMI) and market rate rent. The <strong>tenant-based version of Section 8</strong>, through the Housing Choice Voucher Program, gives households vouchers they can use to pay for rent to any willing landlord. The waitlist for these vouchers is often many years.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="tower">Tower</h3>
<p>See <a href="#podium">Podium</a>.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="vouchers">Vouchers</h3>
<p>See <a href="section-8-housing">Section 8 Housing</a>.</p>
</div> <div> <h3 id="workforce-housing">Workforce Housing</h3>
<p><strong>Workforce housing</strong> is a euphemism for affordable housing serving households earning 60–120% AMI, used to divide people earning “respectable” salaries who cannot afford market rate rents from people who cannot afford market rate rents. It ignores that many people earning less than $57,000 are also a part of the workforce.</p>
<p><strong>###</strong> Zoning</p>
<p>Through <strong>zoning</strong> the local government divides the city into areas with area-specific regulations. Traditionally, zoning has regulated what kind of activities or uses are permissible within a given area: for example, commercial use, single-family housing, multi-family housing, or industrial use. <strong>Form-based zoning</strong> (or form-based code) regulates the design characteristics of an area, such as the maximum or minimum building heights.</p>
<p>Use-based zoning came into prominence in the United States in the 1920s and 30s as an indirect way to ensure racial segregation after the Supreme Court ruled in 1917 that race-based zoning violated the 14th Amendment.</p>
