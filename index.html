    <p>—<em>Hello!</em> and welcome to my little patch of the web. Soon, perhaps, I'll put up a little shelter – maybe somewhere for us to sit and chat? (Meanwhile, for some monologue, see my unresurrected <a href="https://twitter.com/bnjmnbnjmn">twitter</a>.)</p>
    <p>—Among other non-professional identities, I'm an urban planner, which, <em>very sensibly</em>, means things like researching the digitalization of agriculture and, more sensibly, caring about democracy, justice, data and maps.</p>
    <p>—Currently, I'm researching church-led land development projects. If you know of a church developing on its land, let me know <a href="">here</a>!</p>
